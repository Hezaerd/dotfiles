## 🍂 About

Hello there 👋

Welcome to my dotfiles! This repository contains all the configuration files that power my development environment on WSL2 (Debian Trixie). I've curated these files to create an efficient, productive, and aesthetically pleasing setup that works perfectly for my workflow.

I created this repo primarily to backup my config files and easily deploy them on new machines. My goal is to maintain a simple yet highly customizable environment that I can quickly set up anywhere.

While these configurations are designed for my personal use, they might serve as a useful reference for others looking to streamline their own development setups.

> ![NOTE]
> All configurations related to my **Windows environment** are maintained in a
> separated repository: [windots](https://github.com/hezaerd/windots)
